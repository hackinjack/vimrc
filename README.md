vimrc
=====

This is my collection of vim init files customised to make a sort of python IDE

It works for me, if you like it feel free to use it. If you want to customise It
go right ahead. If you want to provide constructive criticism please do.

If you want to hurl abuse at me because it doesn't work for you, like 'you suck dude, I h8 u'
please don't bother.
